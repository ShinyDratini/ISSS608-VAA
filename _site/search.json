It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\n\n\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\n\n\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\nTwo-sample mean test:

The confidence interval for this difference ranges from -13,059.80 USD to 104,203.30 USD. The p-value is 0.1605, which is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). This suggests that the operational cost is not significantly different between the “Fair” and “Critical” maintenance statuses.\n✅ Good vs. Critical: ✅The difference in operational costs between “Good” and “Critical” maintenance status is 95,727.44 USD. The confidence interval for this difference ranges from 34,271.37 USD to 157,183.50 USD. The p-value is 0.0009, which is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). This indicates that the operational cost is significantly different between the “Good” and “Critical” maintenance statuses.\n✅ Good vs. Fair: ✅ The difference in operational costs between “Good” and “Fair” maintenance status is 50,155.71 USD. The confidence interval for this difference ranges from -9,909.12 USD to 110,220.50 USD. The p-value is 0.1217, which is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). This indicates that the operational cost is not significantly different between the “Good” and “Fair” maintenance statuses.\n✅ Summary: ✅ The Good vs. Critical comparison is statistically significant, indicating that the maintenance status between “Good” and “Critical” has a significant effect on operational costs. The Fair vs. Critical and Good vs. Fair comparisons are not statistically significant, suggesting that there is no significant difference in operational costs between these groups for Container Ship - Steam Turbine.\n\n\n\n\n▶ Show the code\n\n\n# Filter the dataset for Bulk Carrier and Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO)\nbulk_carrier_hfo_data &lt;- subset(df, Ship_Type == \"Bulk Carrier\" & Engine_Type == \"Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO)\")\n\n# Run ANOVA for Operational Cost by Maintenance Status\nanova_model_hfo &lt;- aov(Operational_Cost_USD ~ Maintenance_Status, data = bulk_carrier_hfo_data)\n\n# Run the Tukey HSD test\ntukey_test &lt;- TukeyHSD(anova_model_hfo)\n\n# Print the results of the Tukey test\nprint(tukey_test)\n\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = Operational_Cost_USD ~ Maintenance_Status, data = bulk_carrier_hfo_data)\n\n$Maintenance_Status\n                    diff        lwr       upr     p adj\nFair-Critical -70404.315 -126508.99 -14299.64 0.0095550\nGood-Critical   2772.817  -57093.13  62638.76 0.9934194\nGood-Fair      73177.132   12542.89 133811.38 0.0133808\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTukey HSD test results for the Bulk Carrier (HFO) above:\n\n\n\n✅ Fair vs. Critical: ✅ The difference in operational costs between “Fair” and “Critical” maintenance status is -70,404.32 USD.

This indicates that the operational cost is significantly different between the “Fair” and “Critical” maintenance statuses.\n✅ Good vs. Critical: ✅ The difference in operational costs between “Good” and “Critical” maintenance status is 2,772.82 USD. The confidence interval for this difference ranges from -57,093.13 USD to 62,638.76 USD. The p-value is 0.9934, which is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). This indicates that the operational ## cost is not significantly different between the “Good” and “Critical” maintenance statuses.\n✅ Good vs. Fair: ✅ The difference in operational costs between “Good” and “Fair” maintenance status is 73,177.13 USD. The confidence interval for this difference ranges from 12,542.89 USD to 133,811.38 USD. The p-value is 0.0134, which is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). This suggests that the operational cost ## is significantly different between the “Good” and “Fair” maintenance statuses.\n✅ Summary: ✅ The Fair vs. Critical comparison and the Good vs. Fair comparison are statistically significant, indicating that maintenance status does have an effect on operational costs. The Good vs. Critical comparison is not statistically significant, suggesting that maintenance status between “Good” and “Critical” may not have a significant impact on operational cost for Bulk Carrier - Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO)."

It is an important shipping zone transporting oil, gas and other commodities to and from central and southern Africa. It is also a hotspot for piracy. In 2020, there were 78 piracy incidents and 130 seafarers kidnapped for ransom.\n\n\n\nThis study is conducted to find the correlation between the type of ships and and the revenue they bring in in the Gulf of Guinea. This will allow government officials to better strategize on how to improve ship performance in the region."
